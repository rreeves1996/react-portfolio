## About

<img src='./Capture.PNG' alt='screenshot' width="600">

Started during my Full-Stack Development Bootcamp at the University of Washington, iterated many times over. Created with the hopes of having a lasting, impressionable portfolio that can be continually used until another major overhaul (Three.js anyone?).
Though I had made a strong attempt not to use this portfolio as an experiment for React features and hooks, it, well...became something more? I've been doing my best to keep it simple and focus on refining, NOT dazzling - which parallels my goals for my development journey. My focuses were:
* Mobile-first, responsive layout
* Simple/sleek yet impressive UI
* Easily iterable framework for future additions and refinement

Overall, this was one of my first applications where I felt like I started with a clear - yet flexible - vision and roadmap in mind, and stuck with it throughout the whole application's development. More than the end result, I'm happier with the process - something I've considered my most glaring weakness throughout my life.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Create/organize components to improve app performance
- [x] Reduce JSX clutter through cleaner component/state management
    - [x] Create recurring wrapper for background
    - [x] Refactor navbar to make it easily reusable
    - [ ] Make portfolio projects in to reuseable component
    - [ ] Refactor carousel into component
- [ ] Reorganize file stucture (I'm looking at you, 50 yard long assets images)
- [ ] Clean up and minimize CSS for easier refinement in future
- [ ] Make contact form functional (and a modal?)
